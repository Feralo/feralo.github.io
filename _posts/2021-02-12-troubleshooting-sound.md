When your monitor connection is HDMI but the monitor doesn't have speakers. Sound works over HDMI, but not in the headphone jack. Some have the [opposite problem](https://askubuntu.com/questions/937617/no-hdmi-sound-on-intel-nuc-nuc5i3ryh).



You might want to know how to [set your default sound device](https://askubuntu.com/questions/1038490/how-do-you-set-a-default-audio-output-device-in-ubuntu-18-04/1233100#1233100), but that isn't the problem. The problem is: your desktop only sees HMDI as the output _even when you plug in a headset_.

Suggestions for solutions point to outdated (software packages
for older hardware](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Audio/UpgradingAlsa/DKMS).

Sometimes, it is just plain frustrating.
